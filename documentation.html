    <div class="b"> <b class = "first">Project 1 - Data Visualization</b><br>

    <b>Design Process</b><br>
    The design of this visualization project was made in three parts (Map, Line Plot and Bar Plot). To start with, I made a line plot without any interactions to display the no.of deaths in a selected day.
    Then included a tooltip to provide a bit of interaction to the visualization.<br><br>

    In the futher step, I used the streets.json file to draw a map and included some landmarks such as Brewery, Work House and Broad Street. On further research, I found names of two other streets on a GitHub project and included those on the map.
    Then I plotted the location of deaths with a color hue on gender (both the colors are colorblind safe), and plotted the locations of the water pumps. With a bit of help from my friend, I introduced interaction between line plot and map. 
    The interaction is generated by subtracting the deaths till a selected day and deaths till the previous day.<br><br>

    Finally, I plotted a barplot and converted into grouped bar plot by adding another x1-axis as provided in the d3 examples. The colors filled in the bar plot are colorblind safe. At last, I have included legends and introduced similar tool tips in map and barplot.<br><br>

    <b>Rationale of Design Choices</b><br>
    At first, I chose some random colors to provide gender hue in the visualization. But then changed the colors to make them colorblind safe. The colors are choosen from <a href="https://colorbrewer2.org/#type=qualitative&scheme=Set2&n=3">Color Brewer</a>. <br><br>
    The map consumes a lot of space compared to line and bar plot. Moreover, map is the heart of this visualization. So, I decided to have the map first which will have line plot on it's right. This allows the user to interact between line plot and map easily. 
    Below the map, I have included a legend and a barplot on it's right which is interactive with the line plot.<br><br>


    <b>Insights from the Visualization</b><br>
    The main insights from the Visualization are as follows - 
    <ol>
        <li>The map debunks the theory that cholera is spread through air. Because not every one from the epi-center (broad street) are effected by cholera. People from brewery are not all effected.</li>
        <li>The map provide a insight on the epi-center of the disease. Most of the deaths are in and around broad street.</li>
        <li>But there are some outliers, people far away from broad street are also effected by the disease. But in a less number. This provides the information that every body who has been in contact with broad street are effected. Thus, disease is no infectious in nature.</li>
        <li>The common thing for all the people in the broad street is the water supply (Hand Pump).</li>
    </ol>
        <b>Honerable Mentions</b>
        <ul>
            <li>Thank you TA for your patience and answering all my questions.</li>
            <li>I have received a great amount of help from Sindhuja regarding interacting in line plot and plotting maps.</li>
